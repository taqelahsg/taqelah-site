## Introduction

Playwright has rapidly become one of the most popular tools for end-to-end testing. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up Playwright and writing your first automated tests.

## Why Playwright?

Playwright offers several advantages over traditional testing tools:

- **Cross-browser support**: Test on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API
- **Auto-wait**: Smart waiting eliminates flaky tests
- **Fast execution**: Parallel test execution out of the box
- **Modern features**: Network interception, mobile emulation, and more

## Installation

First, let's install Playwright in your project:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

This interactive setup will:
1. Install Playwright and browsers
2. Create a configuration file
3. Set up example tests
4. Add useful npm scripts

## Writing Your First Test

Here's a simple test to get you started:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('homepage has correct title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');

  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});
```

## Key Concepts

### Locators

Playwright's locators are the foundation of reliable tests:

```javascript
// By role (recommended)
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();

// By text
await page.getByText('Welcome').click();

// By test ID
await page.getByTestId('submit-button').click();
```

### Auto-waiting

Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready:

```javascript
// No manual waits needed!
await page.getByRole('button').click();
await expect(page.getByText('Success')).toBeVisible();
```

### Page Object Model

Organize your tests with the Page Object pattern:

```javascript
class LoginPage {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
    this.usernameInput = page.getByLabel('Username');
    this.passwordInput = page.getByLabel('Password');
    this.submitButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' });
  }

  async login(username, password) {
    await this.usernameInput.fill(username);
    await this.passwordInput.fill(password);
    await this.submitButton.click();
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

Execute your tests with these commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test login.spec.ts

# Debug tests
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use semantic locators**: Prefer role-based selectors over CSS/XPath
2. **Avoid hard-coded waits**: Let Playwright's auto-waiting handle timing
3. **Test in parallel**: Configure parallel execution for faster feedback
4. **Use fixtures**: Share setup/teardown code across tests
5. **Generate reports**: Use built-in HTML reporter for test insights

## Debugging

Playwright provides excellent debugging tools:

```bash
# UI Mode - interactive debugging
npx playwright test --ui

# Trace viewer - analyze test execution
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics:
- Explore network interception for API testing
- Try mobile emulation for responsive testing
- Set up CI/CD integration
- Learn about component testing

## Conclusion

Playwright's modern approach to testing makes it easier than ever to write reliable end-to-end tests. Its auto-waiting, cross-browser support, and developer-friendly API make it an excellent choice for your testing needs.

Happy testing!
